### Fetures
- When hovering an item with the mouse there is no longer drawn a gray rectangle one top. Instead the item becomes slightly larger with an animation.
- When moving an item with shift click, it now moves with an animation into its target slot.
- When scrolling through the hotbar, the current item markere is now animated.
- When opening or closing guis a short animatio will be played.
- All the features above are configurable with animation time (0 to disable) and interpolation curve.

### ToDo
- Compat with ModularUI
- Compat with InventoryBogoSorter

**Note that this might not work correctly in some modded guis!**
